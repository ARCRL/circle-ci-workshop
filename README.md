Remember, this is not a programming exercise, but a CI one; code is only there so you have something to build :)

This repository comes with a maven based java project from the start, but any language can be used. If you want to, just replace the java code with one of the other languages from (this repository)[https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata].
