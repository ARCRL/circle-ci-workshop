# CircleCI workshop

CircleCI is a continuous integration and build Software as a Service (SaaS).

This workshop will go through the basic steps in their system, making you able to make CI builds in the end.

> Note: at the time of writing, CircleCI have a free 2,5 build hours per week, which should be enough for this exercise. But it's not an "all you can eat" buffet :)

## Coding Assignment

While the purpose is to learn CircleCI, this will be a coding assignment. It is made just to give you some tangible code to work with:
Remember, this is not a programming exercise, but a CI one; code is only there so you have something to build :)

This repository comes with a maven based java project from the start, but any language can be used. If you want to, just replace the java code with one of the other languages from (this repository)[https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata].

The description of the application can be read [here](gildedrose.md), but is not necessary yet.

## Tasks

### Fork the repository

You need to have your own repository with the code in order for CircleCI to work, and for you to merge in changes without anybody else conflicting with you.

### Set up the CircleCI configuration

Setting up your repository is fairly simple;

* [login to the website](https://circleci.com/vcs-authorize/)
* Add your forked repository to the CircleCI dashboard: ![add project](img/add-project.png)
* Leave the browser open and go back to the repository on your computer.
* Create a folder named .circleci and add a fileconfig.yml (so that the filepath be in .circleci/config.yml). In the terminal you can do it like this:

```bash
mkdir .circleci
touch .circleci/config.yml
```

Now we have the basis to run a basic `hello world` build in CircleCI

### Making "hello world"

CircleCI is configured through the YAML file we just created.
In order for us to make the first `hello world` script, examine the following example:

```yaml
version: 2.0
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: alpine:3.7
    steps:
      - run:
          name: The First Step
          command: |
            echo 'Hello World!'
            echo 'This is the delivery pipeline'
```

The CircleCI config syntax is very straight forward. The trickiest part is typically indentation. Make sure your indentation is consistent. This is the single most common error in config. Letâ€™s go over the nine lines in details

* Line 1: This indicates the version of the CircleCI platform you are using. 2.0 is the most recent version.
* Line 2-3: The jobs level contains a collection of arbitrarily named children. build is the first named child in the jobs collection. In this case build is also the only job.
* Line 6-7: The steps collection is an ordered list of run directives. Each run directive is executed in the order in which it was declared.
* Line 8: The name attribute provides useful organizational information when returning warnings, errors, and output. The name should be meaningful to you as an action within your build process
* Line 9-11: This is the magic. The command attribute is a list of shell commands that represent the work you want done. The initial pipe, |, indicates that there will be more than one line of shell commands. Here line 10 will print out Hello World! in your build shell and line 11 will print out This is the delivery pipeline

Paste the example into `.circleci/config.yml` and click `start building` in the CI dashboard.

You should see something like this in the logs of CircleCI:

```bash
#!/bin/sh -eo pipefail
echo 'Hello World!'
echo 'This is the delivery pipeline'

Hello World!
This is the delivery pipeline
```

### Making a real pipeline

Up untill now, we have only made sure that CircleCI can reach the configuration file, but not really made it clone down our repository.

tasks:

* replace the image from `alpine:3.7` to the CircleCI docker image that has both JDK and Gradle installed named `circleci/openjdk:8-jdk`

* Under the `steps` part, add another item to the list before run called `- checkout`

* Change the `run` command from the multi-line linux bash script to just run `gradle test` as the command.

Run now, and see that the build runs green and outputs this in the step log:

```bash
gradle test

Welcome to Gradle 5.3!

Here are the highlights of this release:
 - Feature variants AKA "optional dependencies"
 - Type-safe accessors in Kotlin precompiled script plugins
 - Gradle Module Metadata 1.0

For more details see https://docs.gradle.org/5.3/release-notes.html

### Add gradle test step
Once a test step has been added to the pipeline it would be nice to see the results of the tests without having to dig trough output of the individual steps in CircleCI.

To store test results in CircleCI use the following step:
```YAML
- store_test_results:
    path: test-results
```
CircleCI supports a few diffrent test report formats.
https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#store_test_results

Hint: The results of running `gradle test` are stored in a local directory: `build/test-results`.

### Run a few iterations on the code

Having your pipeline set up, now it is time to fix the software problem itself. Go back to [the gilded rose description to read about it](gildedrose.md)

### Building and storing artifacts
To build a jar file run `gradle jar`.

It is possible to store artifacts in CircleCI. This is not to be mistaken for artifact management, but it is a nice way to make files available in the CircleCI web interface.

To store artifacts use the following step:
```YAML
- store_artifacts:
    path: /code/test-results
    destination: prefix
```
More information:
https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#store_artifacts

Hint: The results of running `gradle jar` are stored in a local directory: `build/libs`

### Making docker images

In order to make your own application
Following is an example of building a Docker image using machine with the default image:

```YAML
version: 2
jobs:
 build:
   machine: true
   steps:
     - checkout
     # Login to docker
     - run: docker login -u $DOCKER_USER -p $DOCKER_PASS

     # build the application image
     - run: docker build -t company/app:$CIRCLE_BRANCH .

     # deploy the image
     - run: docker push company/app:$CIRCLE_BRANCH
```

> Hint: you can find information about what Git SHA and other environment variables in https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/ and https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#built-in-environment-variables 

### Workflow

// Want to talk about adding more steps and a workflow.
// That including in "package only if on master" flow

### Extra Reusing build cache
